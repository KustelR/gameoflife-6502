# This is a Conway's game of life written in 6502 assembly.

Why would anyone do this?

Well... My living consitions now doesn't provide any PCs, so i wandered if there any ways to code on smartphone. Writing high level languages is kinda tough (because you need to switch 3 billions of keyboards to put in just a single curled bracket. Long names of api functions, tabulations and other properties of web development makes it really painful to code. This is where 6502 asm comes to help! No tab, no cursed curly brackets. Also language itself provides interesting to overcome challenges and is fun to write.
